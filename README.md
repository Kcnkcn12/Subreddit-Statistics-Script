# Subreddit-Statistics-Script
This script gets posts from a subreddit (max 1000 due to Reddit API's built-in limit). It then filters the posts by day and hour. The script then sorts these categories by the highest average (mean or median) upvotes (proxy metric for viewers).

Good to figure out when a subreddit typically has the most engagement with posts. Use when you want to karma farm or something.
